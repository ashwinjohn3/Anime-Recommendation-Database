    "As per Wikipedia, Anime is hand-drawn and computer animation originating from Japan. The word anime is the Japanese term for animation, which refers to all forms of animated media. Nowadays, a lot of people are finding anime as a great form of entertainment. With its distinctive artstyle and voice-acting, it has garnered a lot of appreciation especially among the youths. As an anime fan myself, I would be exploring and also I will be building an anime recommendation engine based on the dataset - Anime Recommendation Database - which was scrapped from myanimelist.net (also known as MAL)  - a website which facilitates finding users who share similar tastes and provides a large database on anime and manga."

This data set contains information on user preference data from 73,516 users on 12,294 anime. Each user is able to add anime to their completed list and give it a rating and this data set is a compilation of those ratings."
